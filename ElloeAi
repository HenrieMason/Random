Dear Elloe Ai,

I am writing to express my interest in the AI intern position at Elloe AI. With a strong passion for conversational AI and a desire to 
contribute to creating a greener and cleaner future, I believe that my skills and background align perfectly with the goals and requirements of your organization.

I am currently enrolled in Brigham Young University - Idaho, pursuing a degree in data science with a minor in finance. 
My coursework has equipped me with a solid foundation in data analysis, machine learning concepts, and problem-solving skills. 
Additionally, I have hands-on experience working with data analysis tools such as Python, R, and SQL,
which has allowed me to extract meaningful insights and contribute to data-driven decision-making.

The opportunity to work as an AI intern at Elloe AI greatly excites me. Your mission to redefine the 
Conversation AI industry and create a greener future aligns with my own values and aspirations. I am eager to be part of 
a talented and like-minded team that is at the forefront of advancing the state of the art in conversational AI.
Also, not to mention that I have past experience in machine learning, which is very important in AI environments.

I'm very excited for this opportunity and it'd truly be blessing for me to be on your team. Hit me up anytime with my contacts at the top of 
this letter. If not, that's fine! Hope you have a great day!

Sincerely,

Mason Henrie
